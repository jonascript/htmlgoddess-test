      <h1>Hello Seeking Awesome HTML Goddess</h1>
      <p>May 23, 2020</p>
      <p>Hi.</p>
      <p>
        d aaaa s dsdsdfdsddsdf dYofdfu ddmdsday dsd a bedsd s wondering why this
        website looks like it was built 20 years ago. Pleasedsd allow me to explain.
        A few months ago, someone shared
        <a href="https://findingmyrepublicangoddess.com">this website</a> at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure I would ask the same questions of a perspective mate, but it
        was also clear, concise, simple to use, and blazing fast. To top it off it
        had a Google PageSpeed score of 100. A man taught himself HTML and CSS,
        built himself a website, and put it on the internet, <i>to find love</i>. It
        got me thinking, in our ceaseless march towards a bigger and better
        internet, have we forgotten who HTML was originally created for?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I made this
        <a href="https://github.com/jonascript/htmlgoddess">site generator</a>. It's
        a no frills, website generator, which allows you to write HTML and CSS like
        its 1999, as the W3C intended, because
        <strong>
      <i>
        the web should not just be accessible to those wanting to consume, but
        also to those wanting to create
      </i> </strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In setting out on this endeavor I set myself a few principles by which I am
        doing my best to strictly adhere.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It will be
          <strong> <i>simple</i> </strong>{" "} as humanly possible to use. No
          classes, no javascript. No frills. You want fancy, go
          <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">here</a>, you want simple, you've
          come to the right place. Changing a theme is as simple as dropping in any
          stylesheet that targets plain HTML elements,
          <a href="blog/post/seeking-html-goddess.html">like so</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          It will be
          <strong> <i>accessible</i> </strong>{" "} in every sense of the word.
          Accessible not only to people with disabilities, but to people who are not
          programmers, may have slower internet connections, or may need to get
          something up and running quickly without a fuss.
        </li>
        <li>
          It will be
          <strong> <i>extendable</i> </strong>. I have little desire to have to
          argue with people about what should or should not be included in my
          glorious creation. If someone wants to clone this project and turn into a
          code splitted react application, be my guest, but it will always be built
          for someone like my dad who can't figure out how to work the smart TV.
        </li>
        <li>
          It will be
          <strong> <i>fast</i> </strong>. It's time to put the hyper back in
          hypertext. Without all the complexity of what is standard issue with most
          websites, this is actually comes out of the box.
        </li>
        <li>
          It will be{" "}
          <strong> <i>free</i> </strong>. No corporations, middlemen, or censors. If
          you have a computer and you can figure out how to connect it to the
          internet, you can serve whatever website you want.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I honestly don't know if this will be seen by anyone, but if you're out
        there, and you're reading this, and you want to make a website but you don't
        know where to start, you can start here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This framework is very opinionated—in a good way that will make my
        Goddess-HTML-to-Be incredibly happy—beyond their wildest dreams—and keep her
        wildly happy for life!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is flexible on many things. But there are some things it is not flexible
        on. I respect your time. Therefore, I will begin by asking you a series of
        eleven questions to see if you meet the inflexible requirements. If not,
        we'll say goodbye without a kiss.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you manage to make it through all eleven questions without a kiss-less
        goodbye, then I will tell you a lot about myself, the relationship I want,
        and my demanding requirements. I will tell you far, far more than you will
        see in the repositories on any github profile. Then you will have the
        opportunity to download a detailed readme and generate your own HTML
        Goddess. (or just go
        <a href="https://github.com/jonascript/htmlgoddess">here</a>)
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely, Developer Jonathan</p>
